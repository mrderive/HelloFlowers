# HelloFlowers

A hello world abridged implementation of the TensorFlow [Image Classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification).

## Installation

Download the [flower pictures](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz) from Google.

Extract the flower pictures:
```
tar -xvf flower_photos.tgz
```

Clone or download `flower_weights.data-00000-of-00001` and `flower_weights.index`.

Note: Should go without saying, but just in case: you need to have [TensorFlow 2 installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
